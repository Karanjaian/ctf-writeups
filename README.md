# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups! This repository contains detailed solutions and notes for CTF challenges from platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. Each writeup includes a problem description, step-by-step solution, tools used, screenshots, scripts, and lessons learned.

## Structure
- [**HackTheBox**](./HackTheBox): Writeups for HackTheBox challenges and machines.
- [**TryHackMe**](./TryHackMe): Writeups for TryHackMe rooms.

## How to Navigate
Each platform folder contains subfolders for individual challenges or rooms. Inside each:
- `README.md`: Detailed writeup with solution steps and explanations.
- `screenshots/`: Images supporting the writeup (e.g., tool outputs, key findings).
- `scripts/`: Any scripts or code used to solve the challenge.
